# Testing

This file explains how Dewfall is tested: which kinds of tests exist, what each one covers, and which CI workflow runs them. Read it before writing tests or changing a workflow.

## Test layers

### Fast tests

Fast tests run on every change. They cover:

- Reducers.
- Use cases.
- Repositories with fake data sources.
- The YouTube layer against saved responses.
- Room queries.
- Background jobs.
- Screenshot tests of each screen, in light, dark and large font.

Unit tests never touch the network.

### Slow tests

Slow tests are emulator tests of the main flows, such as search then play, and download then play offline.

### Benchmarks

Benchmarks for startup and scrolling run on a real phone before each release.

## CI workflows

The project uses five GitHub Actions workflows.

1. **Every pull request.** Formatting, lint, unit tests, screenshot tests, a database migration check, and a debug build. Branch protection blocks merging when any of them fail.
2. **Every merge to main.** Everything above, plus the emulator tests, and a nightly APK.
3. **Daily schedule.** The YouTube layer runs against real YouTube and opens an issue when something breaks. It never blocks pull requests.
4. **Version tag.** A signed release build, changelog, checksums, and a GitHub release.
5. **Weekly.** Dependency update pull requests from Renovate or Dependabot, tested by workflow 1.
